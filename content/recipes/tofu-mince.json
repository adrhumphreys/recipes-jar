      "step": "Spread the tofu crumbles evenly over the pan. Bake for 30ish minutes, stopping to stir the tofu every now and then. \n"

    {
      "step": "Keep a close eye on it towards the end so that it doesn't burn. You want the tofu to be nice and brown. The smaller crumbles will be darker than the larger crumbles, and that's ok because it will provide a variety of textures."
